This project is as much an exercise in creating a Windows app as it is creating a synth.

A lot of it is boilerplate windows stuff, creating a window, taking keyboard input (and mouse
input that isn't used), translating keyboard input into MIDI, and handling sound output. Inside
of all that there is synth code, handling wave generation for multiple oscillators and volume
envelopes. From a code perspective, making this more functional would be straightforward, but it's
at the point where I would need to write a UI for it and I have no interest in doing that, so this
stays where it is.
